that shocked me at first because I always thought of her as an extremely gentle person. But because I knew she was so kind, I amnaged to stop crying and got back up eventually
I remember thinking Mari-san would never say anything out of plcae. I trusted her completely. At that point Mari-san hugged me and said:
""no matter how many times you fall. You can always get back up and start again. Never forget that."" Can you believe that? I didnt quite understand then but I think I do now

"""any way I can help?""","""...Well perhaps I could share this with you...I mean it would be nice to have someone who is aware of my current situation in life. The source of my worries is my fathers company. Dealing with the aftermath has been...difficult
Given how unexpected the accident was, my father didnt have a will. All of his stocks transferred to me. Which means I'm suddenly the biggest shareholder in a company of over one thousand employees..
But I dont know the first thing about business management or direction or fund management. """
"""that sounds tough""","""it is...I may be the presidents daughter, but I never expected I would end up involved with company matters. Because of that lately Ive been meeting with all the various officers and lawyers my father employed
Theyve been giving me adivce on all the things Im not entirely sure aboue. Assets, stocks. Its clear some people onl want to get on my good side though. I dont kow who I can trust...They try to sound comforting but...
it feels like they're really only being nice so they can get their hands on my bank account. I...I never realized I could be this distrustful of people. Ah, I'm sorry for ranting on about this matter, I feel as though doing so has helped calm me down a bit
the only people Ive consulted up to this point have been employees. But I think what i really needed was someone closer to my own age...closer to my own viewpoint. Um...if it isnt too much trouble, could we speak about this again another time?"""
"""any time""","""In return, I'll...Hm...What can I do to help you? I dont have any unique talents, oh how about this!? You know, gardening, Im actually quite skilled at it. A few years ago I even managed to grow a tropical fruit on the balcony of my home

I grew these right here in these very planters, and harvested them myself not too long ago. Theres not much consistency to their colors or shapes but..."""
"""I want to try them regardless""","""*giggle* you like vegetables Joker? Thats good to know...But to tell the truth I have a favor to ask of you. I'd like to get Sakura-sans opinion on my vegetables. Do you think I could bring my next harvest over to your cafe?

Thank you. Im sure Sakura-san will give me his honest opinion. Ill make sure this next harvest is particularly good. Well then, shall we head to the hideout?"""
"""the sun bathed vegetables are pretty energizing, these may be useful for when we go into Palaces""","""I agree! Im so happy, I didnt expect this hobby of mine to be helpful to the Phantom Thieves. This is honestly the only thing I can say Im good at"""

"""of course""","""its a deal! *giggle* we're like real phantom thieves. Okay I'll do my best! Still he was right...The taste leaves much to be desired...
Thank you for having me. Your feedback on the vegetables was a big help. Oh! If there are any vegetables you'd like in particular just let me know. I have plenty of seeds so if you have a preference I'll prioritize those first"""
"""sounds good""","""*giggle* leave it all to me. After all this is my own way of contributing to the Phantom Thieves. All right Im going home for the day, see you later"""
"""are you opening a Cafe?""","""*giggle* would you come if I was? I mean doesnt the idea of a boutique sound lovely? Anyway I recently discovered the joy in the taste and aroma of coffee. I used to think it was just bitter, but now i understand the depth of its flavor
to tell you the truth I wasnt even able to drink it before. Ah pardon me I was just thinking back on the past. Um...can I share something with you again? As I mentioned before I cant bring myself to trust anyone at Okumura Foods
for as long as I can remember the company has been run by my father. Being liked by him was always very important. Some employees would even come to ingratiate themselves to me. But since his passing things have gotten unruly
most evidently people have started trying to use my influence as majority shareholder to oust other employees. They say they come to me out of respect but I know they're just trying to use me, Ive heard so many rumors...
the worst ones are about Takakura-san, the new president. They say he was thrilled by my fathers passing. There may be truth to that, hes been with the company for years but hes only started being nice to me recently
he even offered to assist me with asset management. I fear he has an ulterioir motive though"""
"""he sounds suspicious""","""yes I cant help but wonder about him. He even went as far as to recomment i sell my shares the other day saying I could make a fortune...but I realized if I did he would be able to strike the Okumura name completely. He must be scheming"""
"""this is a complex issue""","""indeed it is. None of the advice Ive gotten so far has been helpful either. Everyone only speaks out of their own self-interest...Thank you for today thought, I feel a little better after talking about this with you. Dont worry, I'll find a way to keep going
Im going to stay here a bit longer to check on the drainage, I need to make sure these veggies turn out as good as possible for the Phantom Thieves"""
"""dont worry it'll be okay, I promise""","""*giggle* you're so dependable, in that case we can be partners in crime! Honestly Joker, I really enjoy the time we spend together...its so different from how I feel when Im around him. Oh sorry...I meant my fiance Sugumura
that reminds me thought I wanted to ask your advice about him. This whole arrangement began when my father first introduced us, around the winter of my second year in high school. I was told we were just meeting his friend for dinner...
didnt take long for that ""friend"" to turn into ""fiance"". It was surprising, but I suppose I had always knowin I would someday be married off for political gain. Oh b-but um...no ""relationship"" stuff happened just to be clear!
a-anyway I was never exactly fond of him to begin with, but now he has grown far worse. Recently hes been suggesing we go on an ""early honeymoon"" together to celebrate our upcoming marriage. I can barely stand to look at him let alone spend time with him
so um...what can I say to decline his offer?"""
"""""I dont want to go with you"" or something like that""","""r-right I suppose being clear would be the best thing I can do. As you know my father passed away before he could fulfill his promise to rescind the marriage proposal, so any talk of putting an end to this marriage would have to come from me
to tell the truth I've already mentioned it to my fiance, but he refuses to listen to a word I say! Apparently hes been telling the employees at Okumura Foods about the contract he made with my father, how the company would pay extreme reparations if it got called off
I just...dont know how to handle this. I can postpone while Im still in high school but after that? Now that I think about it my fathers passing seems to have been quite favourable for him, after all he's engaged to the majority shareholder now
I suppose in the end all he cares about is his own personal gain. But thats not what a relationship is supposed to be built on, it should be something more. Something like, a love so intense that just seeing the other person makes your chest tighten up
have um...have you ever experienced that?"""
"""oh too many times to count""","""really?! *giggle* i guess it makes sense for someone as handsome as you Joker. But theres no spark like that with my fiance, some days I feel like being with him is some kind of training.
Still any hardship I go through now will surely benefit the Phantom Thieves, I will get through this!"""
"""This coffee is delicious""","""well, here we go. It has a distinctly fragrant aroma, paired with a mild flavor. This is undoubtedly delicious coffee, yet I would barely consider it as that. Apparently its brewed using beans gathered from elephant dung"""
"""ah I can taste the elephant!""","""*giggle* I apoligize for not disclosing that ahead of time, I just thought you might find it hard to enjoy if you had known ahead of time. I was surprised to hear it first myself, but that was actually why I wanted to try it to begin with.
another rare type of coffee, kopi luwak, is gathered from the feces of a small cat called a civet. Interestingly enough the flavor differs depending on what animal it was originally consumed by. Oh speaking of cats do you think Mona-chan can-"""
"""we should ask him""","""*giggle* perhaps it would become leblancs new specialty drink. Oh but we need Mona-chan for our operations huh, and we cant have him eating beans all day. Hm...Coffee is so profound..."""
"""can you make some light roast coffee for me?""","""*giggle* Id rather not. I dont think I could ever hope to match the intense depth of Sakura-sans coffee. You know Okumura Foods didnt start out as a burger chain. Originally it was nothing more than a small cafe run by my grandfather. 
unfortunately that shop closed before I could appreciate the finer intricacies of coffee. But thats where the origins of the family business lie. """
"""thats a surprise""","""I know, I had no idea either. My father only mentioned it to me a year or two ago. At any rate after my grandfather passed the company shut the cafe down due to its steady loss of revenue. Grandfather never cared about profit though, he just wanted to make people happy
He built a strong community around the cafe. He even gave out free meals to those who couldnt afford it. Then the day it closed people lined up for blocks to give flowers. They really loved that place and him. 
I wonder if people would line up like that if Big Bang Burger closed down. I know we need to do well to keep our workers paid but I cant help but think we've lost something important. I mean Takakura-san only seems to care about profits...
at this rate we'll never lose our black reputation. """
"""black like coffee?""","""huh..Oh I get it! *giggle* you're so funny Joker. You were trying to cheer me up werent you? thank you for that. *sigh* I think what I really need is to get stronger. I mean I can act tough in front of my workers, but you know how weak I am on the inside
I have a plan though. Before I can really determine who I trust I first need to know what it means to have others trust in me. So Im going to get stronger...strong enough for you and the others to rely on me. Hm but how am I supposed to gain their trust?
Im not great at public speaking, and even just giving my opinion makes me a little nervous. """
"""lets hang out""","""Huh? At a time like this? is this perhaps part of your grand infiltration plan?"""
"""its a secret""","""*giggle* you make it sound like its really important. I suppose relaxation is pretty vital at times like these. Oh yes there was something I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have time to talk today?"""
"""always""","""oh good, do you remember the magic item I mentioned before? The thing that will help me show Takakura-san how I really feel is right here"""
"""the soil?""","""*giggle* correct! You see, the soil here is a special mix I made with a few different kinds of fertilizer, its very high quality. Its soft, its warm, it has good drainage, and its full of nutrients. This, this is the magic I need. 
Im not very good at expressing myself with words...Just thihking about it makes my heart race. But Ive been pirting my heart and soul into this soil for months now, it knows exactly how I feel. Thats why Im going to use it to grow coffee plants
then once they're ready Im going to make coffee with the beans! it shouldnt be much longer now. Honestly, just raising those plants has taken considerable effort. I've checked on them every day, given them water, put them in the sun
and all that love and care has found its way into the beans themselves. Combining that with the nurturing warmth of the soil should give me the perfect way to convey how I feel. I wonder what Takakura-san will think when he tries it"""
"""itll help him understand you""","""yes! I fully believe just that! *giggle* its strange, only recently I was struggling to find belief in anything. By the way I've though about it some more, and I wouldnt necessarily be opposed to Takakura-sans idea. If thats what management wants I wont intervene
at the same time I cant support them if their main goal is to decieve. What I mean is, people dont think of Okumura Foods very highly right now. So..I afraid management is trying to use this new chain to sneak under the radar rather than rebuild trust
of course I understand how hard it is to rid yourself of a negative label. But if they want to fool people with low quality products instead of regaining their trust, I will proudly oppose them. """
"""you're amazing Haru""","""*giggle* well naturally, Im a heroine of justice after all. Heh just kidding. You know Joker, its so reassuring to have you here. Its because of you that I was able to cultivate this soil, and because of you that I have the courage to tell Takakura-san how I feel
Speaking of which, um, do you think you could be there when I do it? As long as you're with me I wont be afraid to say what Im thinking. Now then I need to take some of this soil home to my coffee plants, could you carry a bag for me?"""
"""*takes a sip* Hm...this flavor...interesting. Anyway what is it you wantd ot discuss with me? Does it concern the company?""","""My apologies for bothering you at such a busy time"""
"""its not a problem""","""the truth is, after my fathers passing, I couldnt bring myself to trust anyone at Okumura Foods."""
"""I see...""","""that includes you Takakura-san"""
"""thats quite cruel""","""My apologies. Now then, um, what I wanted to discuss is..."""
"""believe in yourself""","""*giggle* right Ill be okay. Takakura-san, what do you think of my coffee? I grew the beans in my own garden, and even handled the preparation"""
"""what?""","""I honestly dont believe its a particularly good cup of coffee, but I put my heart into making it. Thats why I asked you here today Takakura-san"""
"""hm...""","""im not suggesting we need to put this level of effort into the Okumura Foods coffee chain, and im not suggesting we should put a halt to the plan either. However I wont let my company serve low-quality food to our customers"""
"""you know this is very similar to the coffee your grandfather used to make""","""what!?"""
"""I used to be a regular at his cafe. Thats how I ended up joining the company to begin with. To be honest I strongly opposed the closing of the cafe, but i didnt have the power to make that decision at the time.

O-Oh! I guess I'm already getting better at saying what i think. F-For some reason..just looking at you gives me butterflies. U-um maybe we should go somewhere more private, some of the maids are still around here.
O-Oh but um we definitely cant go to my room! Who knows what they would say about that... Joker...Im so full of emotion I doubt I could even drink coffee right now"""
